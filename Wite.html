                Out of what crypt they crawl, I cannot tell,<br>
                But every night I see the rubbery things,<br>
                Black, horned, and slender, with membranous wings,<br>
                They come in legions on the north wind’s swell<br>
                With obscene clutch that titillates and stings,<br>
                Snatching me off on monstrous voyagings<br>
                To grey worlds hidden deep in nightmare’s well.

            <p class="center3">
                Over the jagged peaks of Thok they sweep,<br>
                Heedless of all the cries I try to make,<br>
                And down the nether pits to that foul lake<br>
                Where the puffed shoggoths splash in doubtful sleep.<br>
                But ho! If only they would make some sound,<br>
                Or wear a face where faces should be found!
