        Out of what crypt they crawl, I cannot tell,<br>
        But every night I see the rubbery things,<br>
        Black, horned, and slender, with membranous wings,<br>
        They come in legions on the north wind’s swell<br>
        With obscene clutch that titillates and stings,<br>
        Snatching me off on monstrous voyagings<br>
        To grey worlds hidden deep in nightmare’s well.
